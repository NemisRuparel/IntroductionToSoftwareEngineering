ch.1  :  Software Development Process Models

WHAT IS SOFTWARE ?
Definition : 
	Software is collection or set of computer programs, procedures, rules or associated documents
	it includes audio, video, images etc.

WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ? 
Definition :
	Software engineering is an enginnering aprroach that covers various stages from planning to maintanance stage

SOFTWARE APPLICATION DOMAIN
	Area of software that it can operate easily

TYPES OF SOFTWARE 
mainly 2 types : Application Software
			     System Software

APPLICATION SOFTWARE : 
--> User requirement
--> Designed to fulfill user requirements
--> Ex., MS Excel, Browser

SYSTEM SOFTWARE : 
--> interface b/w software & hardware 
--> Designed to manage control of hardware and software 
--> Ex., OS, Drivers

CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD SOFTWARE : 
	1.Maintainability
	2.Budget friendly 
	3.Reliability 
	4.Readability
	5.Reusability
	6.Modularity
	7.Functionality
	8.Portability
	9.Proper Documentation
	10.Correctness

SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SOFTWARE :  
	1.Software doesn't wear out 
		any hardware after long use it can be damaged but in case of software it can't be damages , through maintanance it can be upadatable
		it can't affected by "environmental effects"
	2. Software is engineered not manufactured 
		Hardware can't be modifieble but softeware can modifieble for use later on
	3. Reusability of component 
		Once software created it should be scalable , it should have ability to reuse its components
	4. Software is flexible for custom built 
		Software is manufactured from gathering user requirements and for fulfill requirements 


PROGRAM V/S SOFTWARE 
	1. small in size				1.large in size
	2. single developer 			2. team of developer
	3. may not be structured		3. well structured
	4. may not be scalable			4. can be scalable
	5. no or less documentation	5. well documented
	6. may not be maintainable	6. maintainable

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LAYERED APPROACH : 
Four Layers 
	1. Quality 
		it is first layer of layered approach
		software mainly focuses on quality
		it checks wheather output satisfies user's requirement  or not 
		every organization should focus on its software quality		

	2. Process
		it is second layer of layered approach
		it is heart of software engineering		
		main idea behind add process in layered approach is to delivery good software in timely manner

	3. Method 
		it is third layer of layered approach
		it describes 'how  to build' and in which method software should be developed

	4. Tools
		it is fourth and last layer of layered approach
		it executes process in proper layer 
		it supports of its above layer

WHY SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ?
	1. To develop hugh quality software product
	2. To develop large problems
	3. To achieve skill of problem solving
	4. To construct project with agreed cost
	5. To deliver product with timely manner
	6. To become good programmer / developer

UMBRELLA ACTIVITIES
	"Please Follow Simple Rules During Real Software"
	1. P – Project Tracking & Control
	2. F – Formal Technical Review
	3. S – Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
	4. R – Risk Management
	5. D – Document Preparation & Production
	6. R – Reusability Management
	7. S – Software Configuration Management (SCM)

GENERIC PROCESS FRAMEWORK
	1. Communication
	2. Planning
	3. Modeling
	4. Construct
	5. Deployment

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
	1. Birth/Dead
	2. Development
	3. Maturity
	4. Maintenance
