COCOMO Estimation with Cost for Semi-Detached Banking System

Inputs
Size: Assumed 15 KSLOC (based on a Semi-Detached banking system with user/admin interactions, payment processing, and moderate integration).
Project Type: Semi-Detached.
Cost per Person-Month: 25,000 INR.
Basic COCOMO Formulas (Semi-Detached)

Effort (Person-Months): E = 3.0 × (KSLOC)^1.12

Time (Months): T = 2.5 × (E)^0.35
Calculations

Effort:
E = 3.0 × (15)^1.12
(15)^1.12 ≈ 19.90
E ≈ 3.0 × 19.90 ≈ 59.7 Person-Months
Rounded: 60 Person-Months

Time:
T = 2.5 × (60)^0.35
(60)^0.35 ≈ 4.36
T ≈ 2.5 × 4.36 ≈ 10.9 Months
Rounded: 11 Months

Developers:
Developers ≈ 60 ÷ 11 ≈ 5.45
Rounded: 6 Developers

Cost:
Cost = Effort × Cost per Person-Month
Cost = 60 × 25,000 = 1,500,000 INR

Results
Effort: 60 Person-Months
Development Time: 11 Months
Team Size: 6 Developers
Total Cost: 1,500,000 INR








Function Point Calculation for Semi-Detached Banking System

Inputs
System: Banking system based on Level 2 DFD (processes: Make Payment, Profile Management, Admin Operations).
Project Type: Semi-Detached (moderate complexity).
Components

External Inputs (EIs):
Register User, Login, Update Profile, Initiate Payment, Update Account, Admin Action (6 total).
Complexity: Average (4 FPs each, 2–4 DETs, 1–2 FTRs).
Total: 6 × 4 = 24 FPs.

External Outputs (EOs):
Payment Confirmation, Account Statement, Admin Report (3 total).
Complexity: Average (5 FPs each, 5–6 DETs, 2 FTRs).
Total: 3 × 5 = 15 FPs.


External Inquiries (EQs):
View Profile, Check Balance, View Transactions (3 total).
Complexity: Low (3 FPs each, 2–4 DETs, 1 FTR).
Total: 3 × 3 = 9 FPs.

Internal Logical Files (ILFs):
User Database, Account Database, Transaction Log (3 total).
Complexity: Average (10 FPs each, 4–5 DETs, 1 RET).
Total: 3 × 10 = 30 FPs.

External Interface Files (EIFs):
External Bank System (1 total).
Complexity: Low (5 FPs, 3 DETs, 1 RET).
Total: 1 × 5 = 5 FPs.

Unadjusted Function Points
Total: 24 + 15 + 9 + 30 + 5 = 83 FPs.

Value Adjustment Factor (VAF)
General System Characteristics (GSCs):
Data Communication: 3
Distributed Data Processing: 2
Performance: 3
Heavily Used Configuration: 2
Transaction Rate: 4
Online Data Entry: 4
End-User Efficiency: 3
Online Update: 4
Complex Processing: 3
Reusability: 2
Installation Ease: 2
Operational Ease: 3
Multiple Sites: 2
Facilitate Change: 3

Total DI: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 40.

VAF: (40 × 0.01) + 0.65 = 0.40 + 0.65 = 1.05.
Adjusted Function Points
Adjusted FPs = 83 × 1.05 ≈ 87.15
Rounded: 87 FPs.

Result
Total Function Points: 87
